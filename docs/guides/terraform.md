# Terraform Guidance

Terraform code should follow the standard [code guidance](./code.md) in addition to the below principals.

### Repo Organization
As a general rule, we avoid monolithic Terraform state files. Break infrastructure into logical units and define each in its own _stack_ with its own state file.

This modular approach improves maintainability, makes changes easier to test and review, and avoids reduces the blast radius of mistakes and bugs.

### Naming conventions

Follow [HashiCorp’s naming conventions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/best-practices/naming).

Avoid using naming styles from other languages, such as `camelCase` or `PascalCase`. Keep all variable names, inputs, and outputs lowercase with underscores for consistency.

### Use positive variable names to avoid double negatives
To reduce confusion and ambiguity, avoid double negatives in variable names. Use names that express intent clearly. For example: `encryption_enabled`, not `disable_encryption`.

Default values can be either true or false, depending on what makes sense - just keep the naming intuitive.

### Use description field for all inputs and outputs
Every input and output variable should include a description — even when the meaning seems obvious.

If you're exposing a value from an upstream provider (like a Terraform AWS module), reuse the wording from their documentation to stay consistent.

### Provide Sensible Defaults
Modules should work with minimal setup. Where possible, provide secure and production-ready defaults — for example, default to encryption_enabled = true.

This makes modules safer to use and reduces onboarding time for new users.

### Always Use Remote State
State stored on your laptop doesn't help your team. Use remote state backends — like S3 or Azure Storage — so the state is shared, versioned, and protected.

To do this, follow a two-phase approach:

- Create the backend storage (S3, Azure, etc.) without remote state enabled.
- Configure backend {} in your Terraform code and run terraform init to migrate to remote state.

Refer to our guides for setup instructions:

- [AWS Backend Guide](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/devops-terraform-modules/blob/main/terraform-modules/aws/state-file/USAGE.MD)
- [Azure Backend Guide](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/devops-terraform-modules/blob/main/terraform-modules/azure/state-file/USAGE.md)

### Secure your state file
Terraform state files can contain secrets and sensitive data. Protect them accordingly:

- Enable encryption
- Enable versioning
- Apply strict IAM policies

This ensures you can recover from accidental deletions and keep sensitive infrastructure data safe.
